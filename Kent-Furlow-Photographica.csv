The Univex AF series of miniature folding cameras were introduced in 1935.

The AF-2 has a simple, fixed aperture lens. The shutter has settings for instantaneous and time exposure. A wire frame viewfinder is sited through a crude, rectangular, hole cast into the top of the body. Exposures were counted through a red window. The AF-2 is distinguished by a decorative front plate of red, black and gold. Sister models were the AF, AF-3, AF-4 and AF-5, also known as the Minicam. All AF models required Univex #00 film, shooting six 1 1/8 x 1 1/2 inch (28 x 38mm) exposures per roll.

Many Universal Camera Corporation cameras required Univex #00 film including the Univex A, a small Bakelite camera that sold for 39 cents in 1933.",LSU Libraries.
